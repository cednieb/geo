[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A small, focused set of geospatial utilities for JavaScript and TypeScript. @cednieb/geo provides lightweight helpers for geometry teaching course like distance calculations, bounding boxes, centroids, and simple spatial queries. Designed to be modular and tree-shakeable so you can import only what you need.

Features
- Haversine and great-circle distance calculations
- Bounding box (bbox) calculations and expansions
- Centroid and basic geometry helpers
- Point-in-polygon tests
- Lightweight, zero-dependency core intended for both Node and browser environments
- TypeScript type definitions
- Import / Export
- ScreenShots

Browser usage

There are several ways to use the library in the browser:

- With a bundler (Webpack/Rollup/Vite) — import as shown above.
- With a <script> tag, if you publish a UMD build: include the UMD bundle and access window.cedniebGeo or similar (implement if desired).

Development & testing
